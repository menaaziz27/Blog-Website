we have just created in last video how to sign up a new user account 
but they are not allowing to log in using their account yet
so the admin page in django is for only users with admin access
but by default the new users don't have this access so we need to create a log in page for them in the front-end

1) open views.py in your project folder 
2) from django.contrib.auth import views as auth_views
3) add login and logout views that will display when you visit login and logut routes
4) change the default path of them both by adding template_name attribute
5) add login and logout pages in the users app templates
6) copy the register code to both of them and edit each file
7) let's foucs with login now :
   edit the text in login files 

8) if we now go to login/ route it will direct us to the login template which we're created using the django login form
9) let's focus with logout template
   if we didn't specify template_name in logout view and go to logout/ route it'll direct us to logout admin page
   but it's not what we want to have however we want to create our own logout page so we will specify template_name to 
   logout.html file and edit that file

10) let's change our navigation bar so it changes whehnever the user is logged in or logged out
