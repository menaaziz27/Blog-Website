create a new app calls users
add the app to the project
open views.py 
create register view that render register.html file which extends from base tempalte in blog app
create an instance from UserCreationForm
code the register.html file with specific styling
make the form method to "POST" 
when we make a new user to submit and press sign up it reload the register view again 
and if we check the admin page we're not gonna see new users 
and that's because we're posting data from the form and didn't specify where this data should go
so it reloads the register view because it doesn't know what to do
so then we should create form instance with the data posted to the form from the user
by checking if request.method == "POST"
check register function now and come back
. 
.
.
ok so now we're gonna edit base template to edit messages to display in all templates inherites from the base template
{% if messages %}
        {% for message in messages%}
          <div class="alert alert-{{ message.tags }}">
            {{ message }}
          </div>
        {% endfor %}
{% endif %}

so at this point let's 
1) set it up so actually saving the user when the form validates
#if form.is_valid():
#form.save()
2) let's add an additional field so the user enter his email also
	#to add an additional field to the django user form we have to add the field to the form itself
	#so to do this we need to create a new form that inherits from our user creation form 
	#so to do this we want to create a new file where we can put those new forms 
	#forms.py
	#
3) get our form a little bit nicer 
#crispy_forms
4) display a validation feedback to our end user in a better format
